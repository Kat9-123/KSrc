# KSrc
A programme that makes a screenshot of the specified area (sorta like Gyazo)


To use download the .py file and import the modules:
 - Pynput
 - infi.systray
 - win32api
 


Put the file in a folder together with the following items:
 - An empty folder named: KSrc_Screenshots (this is were your screenshots will be saved)
 - An empty file with no extension named: Dir_Save
 - An icon named: KSrcIcon.ico (I would recommend http://www.iconarchive.com/show/small-n-flat-icons-by-paomedia/terminal-icon.html . This is the on I used in the example video)
